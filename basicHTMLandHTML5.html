  <!-- link in the action takes in the data which ypu will submit in the form
    Checkboxes are a type of input.Each of your checkboxes can be nested within
    its own label element. By wrapping an input element inside of a label element
    it will automatically associate the checkbox input with the label element surrounding it.
    All related checkbox inputs should have the same name attribute.It is considered
    best practice to explicitly define the relationship between a checkbox input
    and its corresponding label by setting the for attribute on the label element
     to match the id attribute of the associated input element.-->

    <!-- Here, you have two radio inputs. When the user submits the form with the
       indoor option selected, the form data will include the line: indoor-outdoor=indoor.
       This is from the name and value attributes of the "indoor" input.If you omit the
        value attribute, the submitted form data uses the default value, which is on. In
         this scenario, if the user clicked the "indoor" option and submitted the form,
          the resulting form data would be indoor-outdoor=on, which is not useful. So the
          value attribute needs to be set to something to identify the option.-->
